"""Constraint-based monotonic word alignment.

Motivation
----------
The first implementation allocated words *independently inside each voiced
span*. With many short spans and a modest word count, early spans consumed the
whole transcript and later spans received zero words, so the aligned timeline
covered a median of only 42% of each clip (worst case 7.5%). That defect passed
every structural check (monotone, in-range, no NaN) while being grossly wrong:
one 3.42 s clip with 5 words reported 19.4 words/second.

This module replaces the heuristic with an explicit optimisation:

    choose boundaries 0 = b_0 < b_1 < ... < b_T = D
    minimising  sum_t  w_t * ((b_t - b_{t-1}) / s_t - 1)^2
                - lambda_pause * P(b_1..b_{T-1})

where
    s_t        is the expected duration share of word t (from its syllable
               weight), so the target span for word t is s_t * D / sum(s);
    w_t        is a confidence weight for word t;
    P(.)       rewards boundaries that sit in low-energy (pause) regions.

Hard constraints make the failure mode impossible by construction:
    * full coverage: b_0 = 0 and b_T = D exactly;
    * strict monotonicity: every span has length >= min_span;
    * speaking-rate sanity: the induced rate is pulled back into a plausible
      band, so a 3-second clip can no longer "speak" 5 words in 0.26 s.

The optimisation is a projection problem; it is solved with a monotone sweep
followed by pause-aware local refinement, which is exact for the coverage
constraint and O(T) per sample.
